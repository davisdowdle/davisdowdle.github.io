I'm a junior at BYU studying Actuarial Science and exploring the data science process. Previously, I was an actuarial intern at Milliman CMH Health in Milwaukee, WI. Now I'm a research assistant for the BYU stats department working on modeling American mortality experience by county. I'm also a teaching assistant for the university's Long-Term Actuarial Mathematics course.
