# Exploration

Now that we've got our data, let's dive into some analysis. If you missed how the data was compiled in my last blog post, be sure to check it out <a href="https://davisdowdle.github.io/2023/11/21/data-collection.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Correlation and Collinearity

First and foremost, it may be useful to understand how strongly related the numeric variables are to each other. Below is a correlation heatmap displaying correlation coefficients colored according to strength for each pair of numeric variables. 

![correlation]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/correlation.png)

The most conspicuous thing is the .97 coefficient between population and area. This is rather obvious and doesn't actually tell us much other than that countries that have more land have more space to fit more people. It's not alarming that this relationship is super strong despite the fact that both these variables are predictors because performing a multiple linear regression involving both of these features is outside of the scope of this EDA. 

It's worth noting GDP's coefficient of .36 and .29 with population density and trade ratio respectively. While neither of these correlations are particularly intense, they are strong enough to suspect a statistically significant correlation; this grows my suspicion that there is at least some detectable association between countries that are densely populated and have an export surplus with those that are economically prosperous. Nothing is for certain, but it's something to potentially investigate.

None of the other coefficients are obviously noteworthy.

## GDP Distribution

Another potentially interesting piece of information is what the general distribution of real GDP's per capita is. If this is a random variable, it could be helpful for future analysis what the shape and spread of the raw GDP distribution looks like. Here's a histogram of the data we have.

![gdphist]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/gdphist.png)

Right away, it looks like an exponential distribution may be a good approximation of the shape. However, this doesn't take into account the near-zero likelihood a country realizes 0 GDP per capita. Perhaps a Weibull, gamma, or lognormal, all of which represent better the likelihood of 0 GDP per capita better than the exponential distribution. 

At any rate, it's apparent this is a unimodal distribution skewed heavily to the right. 

## GDP Spread by Region

Having looked at the raw GDP distribution, it would probably be beneficial to see how the distributions differ by region. It's not unlikely that regional distributions differ from each other in a way that will inform our perspective of region down the road. However, it would be helpful to see these distribution exactly side by side on the same chart instead of in several different histograms. A set of boxplots will summarize the regional distributions enough in a comparison-friendly manner.

![boxplot]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/boxplot.png)

The graphic is replete with information. 

Europe is the only region whose median is indisputably above the world average. In fact, every quartile of the European distribution is the highest compared to the respective quartiles of the other regional distributions. It's clear that European countries raise the bar of eceonomic prosperity.

On the other hand, Africa is the exact opposite. Almost every quartile of the African distribution is the lowest compared to the respective quartiles of the other regional dsitributions. Unfortunately, African countries are economically impoverished across the board compared to every other region.

Another important note is that Asia has the single largest spread of GDP's (excluding outliers). Asia arguably has the poorest country but also has some countries ranked reasonably among the richest. 

Conclusions that can be drawn from the boxplots are not limited to these. At the end of the day, one thing is clear--region is an important player in this discussion.

## Trade Ratio

As we saw in the correlation heatmap, there is a possibly interesting correlation between a country having a high GDP per capita and having a higher exports-imports quotient. Let's investigate this a little bit more visually. 

First, let's look at just a raw scatterplot with a linear model overlayed. 

![trade]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/trade.png)

The slope of the line confirms the heat map. Clearly, there is a positive correlation to some degree between the two. This is not to say that exporting more than importing causes economic prosperity; there is simply a positive association. 

Let's analyze this scatterplot further by distinguishing the different regions. 

![traderegion]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/traderegion.png)

There appears to be some level of interaction between region and trade ratio. The association between GDP per capita and trade ratio appears weaker for Oceania, the Americas, and Africa while appearing much stronger for Europe and Asia. As such, it seems that European and Asian countries with higher quotients usually are significantly more prosperous than other countries in the respective regions with lower quotients. On the other hand, knowing the quotient of a country in the other regions doesn't give us as much information about that country's economic prosperity.

## Population Density

The heat map also revealed that there may be a possible correlation between a country having a high GDP per capita and being more densely populated as well (though to a lesser degree than trade ratio). Let's investigate this in a similar manner. 

Again, let's analyze the raw scatterplot first with a linear model overlayed.

![density]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/density.png)

Just like the trade ratio, the graphic confirms the heat map--there is some positive correlation between countries that have dense populations and those that have higher GDP's per capita. Again, this is not to say that health officials and executive should intentionally pack higher populations into smaller areas to cause higher economic yield. There is no evidence this would be effective. We simply know there is an assocation.

Now, let's look at how region affects population density's contribution to GDP per capita.

![densityregion]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/densityregion.png)

This graphic offerrs us different information from the trade ratio. 

In this category, it appears Oceania is the only region that has a negative correlation. This means that countries in Oceania with higher population concentrations are usually poorer than their sparser Oceanic counterparts. No other regions exhibits this behavior. Very curious. I have no idea why that might be. 

It's also interesting that the Americas is the region whose association between the response and population density is most positive. This means that more than any of the other regions, knowing a country in North or South America is more densely populated than another implies that the former is usually more likely to be more prosperous. Much like Oceania, I have no idea why that is. 

Repetitively, the data is showing us that region is a very impactful, multi-faceted variable. 

## Currency

Finally, let's see if currency intuitively has any notable correlation with GDP per capita. It would make sense that countries who unite currencies usually become more economically stable. After all, the European Union was started to foster stable growth and commerce between its constituents in part by establishing a common currency. Therefore, let's analyze if the number of countries employing a currency has any relationship with the general economic helth of those nations.

![currency]({{site.url}}.{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/currency.png)

Unfortunately, it looks like we've hit a roadblock. The data is very unbalanced because the majority of countries use their own unique marks. Knowing a country has its own isolated currency gives very little information about its prosperity given that those currencies with only one subscribed country span the entire average GDP spectrum. Those currencies recognized by more than one country don't visually seem particularly advantageous compared to those recognized by only one. 

We can therefore conclude that we don't have enough evidence to show that currency is an impactful variable when considering GDP per capita.

# Conclusions

Here's some key takeaways: Some variables are more important than others. In this case, it looks like region is critical, population density and trade are important, and currency is negligible. More specifically, it seems that region interacts with population density and trade to predict GDP per capita. This will be most helpful moving forward in the modeling and machine learning process. 

I also can't say the data is flawless. Some of the data came from different sources that may significantly affect the efficacy of the data holistically. Different observations also had to be obtained from different years because that was what was available. Basically, not all the data in the set is equal. Economies are also extremely complex creatures dependent on tons of variables; we've seen that banking, fiscal policy, and other institutions hardly touched in this inquiry are indicative of economic health. If we truly want to see some meaningful conclusions for this question, we're going to need to merge a lot more tables.
